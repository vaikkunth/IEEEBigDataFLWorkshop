    <div class="overview">
<p>Machine learning models benefit from big, diverse training datasets. However, the sensitivity of the data and strict government regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA restrict organizations from sharing data. As such, entities with sensitive datasets can only develop locally optimal models. However, for robust, globally optimal models, that are highly generalizable, training needs to happen across organizational boundaries. Federated learning (FL) facilitates this by enabling the development of global models without sharing sensitive data.


<p>However, FL has challenges, such as privacy inferences, convergence, and bias concerns due to data heterogeneity amongst clients, security, cost, trust, regulation, etc. All these concerns have to be addressed to make FL practically scalable and useful. 

<p>We are expecting broader, comprehensive, and greater application of these concepts and technologies and convergence towards holistic big data ecosystems. The goal of the workshop is to provide an open forum for industry experts, researchers, system-builders, and students interested in FL for Big Data.
